# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution

## Abstract

This project focuses on predicting bike sharing demand using AutoGluon, an automated machine learning framework. The process involves initial training, exploratory data analysis, feature creation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Key findings include the importance of proper output formatting for submission, the effectiveness of feature engineering in enhancing model performance, and the significant impact of hyperparameter tuning on improving predictive accuracy. The project concludes with recommendations for further model refinement, highlighting the iterative nature of predictive modeling and the importance of data analysis, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization in maximizing model effectiveness.
